I am doing this actvity to get familar with the Flask framework and creating APIs with it.
I followed a series of online tutorials to complete this.

Flask is a micro web framework in Python. 
It allows you to create web applications with minimal overhead.

@app.route('/') = route decorator that tells Flask which URL should trigger the function directly below it. 
In this case, the root URL (/) triggers the home function.
A route decorator in Python is a function that wraps another function usually a view function in a web app likr Flask or FastAPI.
The decorator function takes the original function as an argument and returns a new function that “wraps” the original.

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

jsonify(line 7) This function converts the tasks list to a JSON format, which is commonly used in APIs for data interchange.
